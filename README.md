_Books_

* Apprenticeship Patterns: http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html

I suggest approaching this book by reading the introduction, and then using [this list](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/apa.html) to figure out which parts you want to read based on situations that sound similar to you. 

_Suggestion for this week_

- At the end of the work day, write down 1 thing that went well and 1 thing that could've gone better, especially making note of anything that blocked you from doing something
- Identify one feature in the backlog at work that you'd like to do that is just outside your comfort zone, and we'll work together to figure out what makes it out of reach, and make a plan to acquire the knowledge (or whatever it is) that you need to be feel comfortable taking it on.
